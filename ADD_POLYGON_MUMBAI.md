# 🔗 How to Add Polygon Mumbai Testnet to MetaMask

Polygon has rebranded, but **Mumbai testnet still exists**! Here's how to add it.

## Method 1: Manual Addition (Recommended)

1. Open MetaMask
2. Click network dropdown → "Add Network" → "Add a network manually"
3. Enter these **exact** details:

```
Network Name: Polygon Mumbai
RPC URL: https://rpc.ankr.com/polygon_mumbai
Chain ID: 80001
Currency Symbol: MATIC (or POL - both work)
Block Explorer URL: https://mumbai.polygonscan.com
```

4. Click "Save"

## Method 2: Use Chainlist (If Available)

1. Go to https://chainlist.org/
2. **Make sure "Include Testnets" is checked** ✅ (top right)
3. Search for: **"Mumbai"** or **"Polygon Mumbai"**
4. Look for:
   - **Name**: Mumbai or Polygon Mumbai
   - **Chain ID**: 80001
   - **Testnet**: Yes
5. Click "Add to MetaMask"
6. Approve in MetaMask

## Method 3: Alternative RPC URLs

If the first RPC doesn't work, try these:

**Option A (Alchemy):**
```
RPC URL: https://polygon-mumbai.g.alchemy.com/v2/demo
```

**Option B (Infura):**
```
RPC URL: https://polygon-mumbai.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_KEY
```

**Option C (Public):**
```
RPC URL: https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com
```

## ✅ Verify It's Added Correctly

After adding, check:
- Network name shows "Polygon Mumbai" or "Mumbai"
- Chain ID is **80001**
- Currency shows MATIC or POL
- You can see the network in MetaMask dropdown

## 🪙 Getting Test Tokens

Once Mumbai is added:

1. Copy your wallet address from MetaMask
2. Go to: https://faucet.polygon.technology/
3. Select **"Mumbai"** network
4. Select **"MATIC Token"** (or POL if that's the option)
5. Paste your address
6. Click "Submit"
7. Wait 1-2 minutes

## 🔍 If You Still Can't Find It

The testnet might be listed as:
- "Mumbai" (without "Polygon")
- "Polygon Amoy" (newer testnet - Chain ID: 80002)
- Check Chainlist with testnets enabled

**Note**: Polygon Amoy is the newer testnet, but Mumbai (80001) still works for our project!

**Once added, you're ready to get test tokens!** 🚀
