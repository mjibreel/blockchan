# 🪙 How to Get Test MATIC Tokens (Polygon Amoy)

**⚠️ UPDATE: Polygon Mumbai is deprecated! Use Polygon Amoy instead.**

You need test MATIC tokens to pay for gas fees when deploying contracts and stamping files.

## 🚀 Quick Steps

### Step 1: Add Polygon Amoy to MetaMask

1. Open MetaMask
2. Click the network dropdown (top center)
3. Click "Add Network" or "Add a network manually"
4. Enter these details:

```
Network Name: Polygon Amoy
RPC URL: https://rpc-amoy.polygon.technology
Chain ID: 80002
Currency Symbol: MATIC
Block Explorer URL: https://amoy.polygonscan.com
```

**OR** use Chainlist (easier):
1. Go to https://chainlist.org/
2. **Enable "Include Testnets"** ✅
3. Search for "Polygon Amoy" or "Amoy"
4. Click "Connect Wallet"
5. Click "Add to MetaMask"

### Step 2: Get Your Wallet Address

1. Open MetaMask
2. Make sure you're on Polygon Mumbai network
3. Click your account name at the top
4. Copy your wallet address (starts with `0x...`)

### Step 3: Get Test MATIC from Faucets

Try these faucets (in order):

#### Option 1: Official Polygon Faucet ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**
- **URL**: https://faucet.polygon.technology/
- **Steps**:
  1. Select **"Amoy"** network (NOT Mumbai - it's deprecated!)
  2. Select "MATIC Token"
  3. Paste your wallet address
  4. Click "Submit"
  5. Wait 1-2 minutes
  6. Check MetaMask for tokens

#### Option 2: Alchemy Faucet
- **URL**: https://mumbaifaucet.com/
- **Steps**:
  1. Paste your wallet address
  2. Complete captcha
  3. Click "Send Me MATIC"
  4. Wait 1-2 minutes

#### Option 3: QuickNode Faucet
- **URL**: https://faucet.quicknode.com/polygon/mumbai
- **Steps**:
  1. Connect wallet or paste address
  2. Request tokens
  3. Wait for confirmation

#### Option 4: PoW Faucet (if others don't work)
- **URL**: https://mumbaifaucet.com/
- Sometimes requires solving a captcha or waiting

### Step 4: Verify You Received Tokens

1. Open MetaMask
2. Make sure you're on "Polygon Amoy" network
3. You should see "MATIC" balance (should be > 0)
4. You can also check on PolygonScan:
   - Go to: https://amoy.polygonscan.com/
   - Paste your address in search
   - Check "Balance" section

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### "Faucet says I already received tokens"
- Each faucet has a cooldown period (usually 24 hours)
- Try a different faucet
- Make sure you're requesting for **Amoy** network, not Mumbai (deprecated) or mainnet

### "Tokens not showing in MetaMask"
- Make sure you're on **Polygon Amoy** network (not Mumbai, not Ethereum)
- Refresh MetaMask
- Check your address on PolygonScan (amoy.polygonscan.com) to confirm

### "Need more tokens"
- Each faucet gives ~0.1-0.5 MATIC
- For hackathon, 0.5 MATIC should be enough for many transactions
- If you need more, wait 24 hours and request again

## 💡 Tips

- **Save your wallet address** somewhere - you'll need it often
- **Keep some MATIC** for gas fees (each transaction costs ~0.001-0.01 MATIC)
- **Test transactions** are free (testnet), but you still need MATIC for gas

## ✅ Checklist

- [ ] Polygon Amoy added to MetaMask (Chain ID: 80002)
- [ ] Wallet address copied
- [ ] Requested MATIC from faucet (select Amoy network!)
- [ ] MATIC balance > 0 in MetaMask
- [ ] Ready to deploy contract!

**Once you have MATIC, you can deploy the smart contract!** 🚀
