# 🔗 How to Add Polygon Amoy Testnet to MetaMask

**Polygon Mumbai has been deprecated!** Use **Polygon Amoy** instead (the new testnet).

## Method 1: Manual Addition (Recommended)

1. Open MetaMask
2. Click network dropdown → "Add Network" → "Add a network manually"
3. Enter these **exact** details:

```
Network Name: Polygon Amoy
RPC URL: https://rpc-amoy.polygon.technology
Chain ID: 80002
Currency Symbol: MATIC
Block Explorer URL: https://amoy.polygonscan.com
```

4. Click "Save"

## Method 2: Use Chainlist

1. Go to https://chainlist.org/
2. **Make sure "Include Testnets" is checked** ✅ (top right)
3. Search for: **"Amoy"** or **"Polygon Amoy"**
4. Look for:
   - **Name**: Polygon Amoy
   - **Chain ID**: 80002
   - **Testnet**: Yes
5. Click "Add to MetaMask"
6. Approve in MetaMask

## ✅ Verify It's Added Correctly

After adding, check:
- Network name shows "Polygon Amoy"
- Chain ID is **80002** (not 80001!)
- Currency shows MATIC
- You can see the network in MetaMask dropdown

## 🪙 Getting Test Tokens

Once Amoy is added:

1. Copy your wallet address from MetaMask
2. Go to: https://faucet.polygon.technology/
3. Select **"Amoy"** network (not Mumbai!)
4. Select **"MATIC Token"**
5. Paste your address
6. Click "Submit"
7. Wait 1-2 minutes

## 📝 Important Notes

- **Mumbai (80001) is deprecated** - don't use it!
- **Amoy (80002) is the new testnet**
- Same functionality, just different network
- All our code is now updated to use Amoy

**Once added, you're ready to get test tokens!** 🚀
